/*
Coding Steps:
Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:
1. Use at least one array.
2. Use at least two classes.
3. Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.
 

Video Steps:
Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.
* This video should be done using screen share and voice over.
* This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend.
* You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording.
* This will create a video recording on your computer.
* This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube.
* Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!
